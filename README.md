# MHCHPSO

MHCHPSO is a novel meta-heuristic algorithm for the coverage optimization of wireless sensor networks that can be used in a variety of irregular environments.

The development software for MHCHPSO is Matlab 2018a. MHCHPSO.m is the MHCHPSO body, cec17_func.mexw64 is the publicly available benchmark test set, WSNC is used to generate the deployment environment of WSN, main.m is the test program entry, and WSN_main.m is the test program entry of the WSN coverage optimization problem.

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are widely used in many situations, but the disordered and random deployment mode will waste a lot of sensor resources. This paper proposes a multi-topology hierarchical collaborative particle swarm optimization (MHCHPSO) to optimize sensor deployment location and improve the coverage of WSN. MHCHPSO divides the population into three types topology: diversity topology for global exploration, fast convergence topology for local development, and collaboration topology for exploration and development. All topologies are optimized in parallel to overcome the precocious convergence of PSO. This paper compares with various heuristic algorithms at CEC 2013, CEC 2015, and CEC 2017. The experimental results show that MHCHPSO outperforms the comparison algorithms. In addition, MHCHPSO is applied to the WSN localization optimization, and the experimental results confirm the optimization ability of MHCHPSO in practical engineering problems.
